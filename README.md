## Getting Started

To view the website locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:amuwal/urk-markup.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd urk-markup
    ```

3. Install the dependencies using npm or yarn:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

    or

    ```
    yarn install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```
        npm start run
    ```
    or
    ```
        yarn start run
    ```
5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the website.

Now, the React website should be up and running on your local machine. 

Please note that these steps assume you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn installed on your machine. If you haven't installed them yet, you can download the latest stable version of Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/
